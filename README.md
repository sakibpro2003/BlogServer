# BlogProject

Overview

This project is a backend system for a blogging platform where users can write, update, and delete their blogs. The system features role-based access control, allowing users to manage their own blogs while admins can manage users and their content. The public API provides features like search, sorting, and filtering for blog posts.



## Project Overview

The **Bi-Cycle Shop Management System** is designed to manage a Bi-Cycle shop’s product catalog and customer orders. Key functionalities include:

- **Product Management**: Admins can manage different Bi-Cycle products in the shop’s inventory.
- **Order Management**: Customers can place orders, which track the quantity and total cost of products.
- **Revenue Calculation**: The system calculates the total revenue by multiplying the quantity of Bi-Cycles ordered by their price.

## Features

### Product Management:
- Add, update, and list Bi-Cycles available for sale.
- Store details like price, description, quantity, and stock status.

### Order Management:
- Customers can create orders specifying the product and quantity.
- Automatically deducts quantity from inventory when an order is placed.

### Revenue Calculation:
- The system calculates the total revenue generated from all orders.
- Provides a revenue summary with the total amount earned.

### RESTful API:
- Exposes endpoints to interact with products, orders, and revenue calculations.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB (NoSQL database)
  - Mongoose (Object Data Modeling for MongoDB)

- **Other**:
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Postman for API testing

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** installed locally or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for cloud-based MongoDB.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bi-Cycle-shop-management.git
    cd Bi-Cycle-shop-management
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://<your-database-uri>
    ```

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will run the application on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Configuration

### MongoDB URI:
Modify the `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file to point to your MongoDB instance. You can use MongoDB Atlas if you're hosting your database in the cloud:
```plaintext
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/Bi-Cycle?retryWrites=true&w=majority


## Notes:
- Replace `<product_id>`, `<order_id>` with actual product/order IDs in the request and response data.
- Make sure MongoDB is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based hosting.
- Adjust the values for product prices, quantities, and orders based on actual data in the database.
